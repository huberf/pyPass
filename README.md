A Minimal Python Password Manager

Specs:
64-bit AES encryption

Setup:
1. Use the built-in c0d3sPl41n.txt file or make your own (technical users only),
   and fill it with passwords using the same format shown in the c0d3sPl41n.txt
   file.
2. Run `python encrypt.py` and enter a password string.
3. Feel free to delete c0d3sPl41n.txt. Your encrypted passwords are now stored
   by default in c0d3sC1ph3r.txt
4. Run 'python password.py' and then enter your password string.
5. Use its case insensitive search to find your account and password.
6. Profit!

Although the AES encryption should be strong enough for many tasks, I cannot
guarantee password security.
